If you are a DM register and Select the DM Role. This will allow you to create parties that your players can join. From there you can modify their XP and Coins, as well as remove players from the parties. If you select the view to see all your parties you can delete existing parties from that page.

If you are a Player register and select the Player Role. This will allow you to see all currently active parties, simply click on the party your DM created and join it. From there you can create your character in the party and adjust your own XP and Coins. If you go to the screen to see all of your characters you can delete them on that page. If you leave a party without deleting your character and then rejoin the party your character should be pulled back in. You can click the green see your parties button to see all of the parties you are currently in.
